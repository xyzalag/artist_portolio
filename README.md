Responsive, Mobile-First Portfolio Website. Simple, custom project (no templates). Made mainly with HTML5, CSS3 and a pinch of JavaScript (tools: node.js, npm, gulp). The class system is based on BEM (Block Element Modifier). The ‘styles’ were developed using post-css , mixins and variables. The final code is compiled and minified (image-min, use-min, cssnano, babel). 
FancyBox 3 was used (http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/) providing responsive, fast-loading gallery.
